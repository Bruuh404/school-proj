        <h2>BEST TOUR ALIVE</h2>
        <p>
          Kendrick Lamar, which has been argued to be the best rapper alive, is
          back on tour with his new album "Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers",
          together with colleague Tanna Leone and cousin Baby Keem. We sent out
          our finest reviewers to this concert and to summarize it, it is one
          hell of a concert as well as a fantastic story from the poet Kendrick
          Lamar. Read more about the full review here!

        <h1>YE DESTROYS DISABLED KIDS AT BASKET</h1>
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            Ye West formerly known as Kanye West offered a bunch of make-a-wish
            kids a game of basketball, where he was one man going against a
            bunch of disabled kids. Ye had no plans on standing down or going
            easy on the kids and won with 120 points against the kids who had 20
            points. The parents are furious with the man and the kids are
            mesmerized from this traumatic experience. Ye has yet to say
            anything about this act.

        <h2>NATIONAL DAY DISASTER</h2>
        <p>
          Yesterday Argentina and Saudi Arabia went head to head in a game of
          football in the world cup, ending in a 2-1 win for Saudi Arabia. This
          was something that the Saudis did not expect, they ended up giving
          every team player a rolls royce as well as a whole national day. Read
          more to find out how this Argentinian catastrophy went down here!
